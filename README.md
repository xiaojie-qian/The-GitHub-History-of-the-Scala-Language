# The-GitHub-History-of-the-Scala-Language
## Project Description: 
- We're going to read in, clean up, and visualize the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). We will find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
